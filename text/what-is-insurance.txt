What is Insurance?
Imagine insurance as a safety net for when something unexpected happens. You pay a small amount of money regularly (called a premium) to an insurance company. In return, if something bad happens that's covered by your insurance, the company helps you out.

For example, with car insurance, if you get into an accident, the insurance company pays for some or all of the repairs. With health insurance, it helps cover your medical bills when you're sick. And with life insurance, if you pass away, your family gets some money from the insurance company to help them out.

So, insurance is like a protective shield that helps you deal with problems and unexpected situations, and you pay a bit of money to have that shield in place.
