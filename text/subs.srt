00:00:00,176 --> 00:00:01,314 
What is Insurance

2
00:00:01,453 --> 00:00:05,708 
Imagine insurance as a safety net for when something unexpected happens

3
00:00:06,004 --> 00:00:10,692 
You pay a small amount of money regularly (called a premium) to an insurance company

4
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:11,683 
In return

5
00:00:12,026 --> 00:00:15,018 
if something bad happens that's covered by your insurance

6
00:00:15,216 --> 00:00:16,605 
the company helps you out

7
00:00:16,945 --> 00:00:17,752 
For example

8
00:00:17,913 --> 00:00:19,066 
with car insurance

9
00:00:19,325 --> 00:00:20,975 
if you get into an accident

10
00:00:21,302 --> 00:00:23,355 
the insurance company pays for some or all of the repairs

11
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:23,721 
With health insurance

12
00:00:23,825 --> 00:00:24,886 
it helps cover your medical bills when you're sick

13
00:00:25,053 --> 00:00:26,242 
And with life insurance

14
00:00:26,528 --> 00:00:29,093 
if you pass away

15
00:00:29,435 --> 00:00:31,010 
your family gets some money from the insurance company to help them out

16
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:32,456 
So

17
00:00:32,807 --> 00:00:36,412 
insurance is like a protective shield that helps you deal with problems and unexpected situations

18
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:37,067 
and you pay a bit of money to have that shield in place

19
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,121 


20
00:00:41,233 --> 00:00:43,206
