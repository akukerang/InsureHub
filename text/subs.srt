00:00:00,197 --> 00:00:01,174 
What is Insurance

2
00:00:01,671 --> 00:00:05,568 
Imagine insurance as a safety net for when something unexpected happens

3
00:00:06,024 --> 00:00:08,095 
You pay a small amount of money regularly 

4
00:00:08,492 --> 00:00:09,466 
called a premium

5
00:00:09,714 --> 00:00:10,965 
to an insurance company

6
00:00:11,471 --> 00:00:12,185 
In return

7
00:00:12,448 --> 00:00:15,359 
if something bad happens that's covered by your insurance

8
00:00:15,659 --> 00:00:16,884 
the company helps you out

9
00:00:17,443 --> 00:00:18,174 
For example

10
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,665 
with car insurance

11
00:00:19,941 --> 00:00:21,253 
if you get into an accident

12
00:00:21,531 --> 00:00:24,572 
the insurance company pays for some or all of the repairs

13
00:00:25,004 --> 00:00:26,193 
With health insurance

14
00:00:26,444 --> 00:00:28,671 
it helps cover your medical bills when you're sick

15
00:00:29,283 --> 00:00:30,599 
And with life insurance

16
00:00:30,876 --> 00:00:31,831 
if you pass away

17
00:00:32,164 --> 00:00:35,781 
your family gets some money from the insurance company to help them out

18
00:00:36,261 --> 00:00:36,633 
So

19
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:42,120 
insurance is like a protective shield that helps you deal with problems and unexpected situations

20
00:00:42,421 --> 00:00:45,189 
and you pay a bit of money to have that shield in place
